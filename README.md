ask : Customer Churn Prediction Model Project

Project Overview

Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn, helping the com- pany proactively identify and retain at-risk customers.

 

Objectives

•  Build a predictive model that accurately forecasts customer churn

•  Create a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline

•  Develop insights into key factors influencing customer departure

•  Prepare a presentation of findings and model performance

 

Project Stages and Detailed Tasks
1.   Data Collection and Preparation

□   Obtain customer dataset (typically including features like):


•  Demographics (age, gender, location)

•  Account information (tenure, contract type)

•  Service usage metrics

•  Customer interactions

•  Historical transaction data


2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

□   Clean and preprocess the dataset


•  Handle missing values

•  Remove or impute anomalies

•  Normalize or standardize numerical features


□   Conduct statistical analysis of churn patterns

□   Create visualizations to understand:


•  Distribution of churn vs. non-churn customers

•  Correlation between features and churn

•  Key indicators of potential customer departure


□   Generate initial insights report


 

3.  Feature Engineering

□   Identify and create relevant features

□   Perform feature selection


•  Use techniques like correlation analysis

•  Apply feature importance algorithms


□   Create derived features that might improve prediction

□   Reduce dimensionality if necessary

□   Document feature engineering process

 

4.  Model Development

□   Split data into training and testing sets

□   Implement multiple machine learning algorithms:


•  Logistic Regression

•  Random Forest

•  Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

•  Support Vector Machine


□   Perform cross-validation

□  Tune hyperparameters using techniques like:


•  Grid Search

•  Random Search

•  Bayesian Optimization

 

5.   Model Evaluation

□   Calculate and compare performance metrics:


•  Accuracy

•  Precision

•  Recall

•  F1 Score

•  ROC AUC Curve

□  Create confusion matrix

□  Analyze model interpretability

□  Identify most important predictive features

                    □  Compare performance across different algorithms
 

            6.   Model Deployment Preparation

□   Develop a prediction pipeline

□   Create documentation for model usage

□   Prepare model for potential integration

□   Design a simple interface for model predictions
