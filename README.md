## **üìä Project Stages and Tasks**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection and Preparation**
#### **Tasks:**
- Obtain customer dataset with features like:
  - **Demographics:** Age, gender, location.
  - **Account information:** Tenure, contract type.
  - **Service usage metrics:** Internet, phone, and streaming service usage.
  - **Customer interactions:** Support requests, service issues.
  - **Historical transaction data:** Payment history, billing information.

#### **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
- Handle missing values using imputation or removal.
- Remove or address anomalies.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.
